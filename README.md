# Redux Toolkit Tutorial

## Intro

- `What is Redux`: It is a predictable state container for JS apps
- `State Container`: It stores the state of the application, which is shared by all the individual components of that app.
- `Predictable`: A pattern is enforced to ensure all state transitions are explicit and can be tracked, hence making changes predictable.

- `What is Redux Toolkit`: It is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It is an abstraction on top of Redux to simplify development using Redux. The _React Redux_ connects Redux toolkit to React. It provides bindings to use React and Redux Toolkit together in an application.
